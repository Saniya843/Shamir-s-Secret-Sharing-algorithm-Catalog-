# Shamir-s-Secret-Sharing-algorithm-Catalog-
This repository implements a simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm to solve for the constant term  𝑐 c of a polynomial using given encoded roots. The project involves parsing JSON input, decoding values from different bases, and applying mathematical techniques such as Lagrange interpolation to compute the secret.
